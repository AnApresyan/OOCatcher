# OOCatcher

A simple C++/Raylib game where you guide a stickman to catch and throw balls at randomly placed targets.  
All core game logic remains hand-crafted, with AI assistance handling the underlying mathematical calculations (trajectories, timings, physics) to keep the code clean and focused on gameplay.
